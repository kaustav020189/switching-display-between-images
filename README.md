switching-display-between-images
================================

This piece of code directs you how to change instantly the image that is being currently displayed to some other predefined image of your choice. This predefined image can be in the form of a URI or can be fetched from database using the JQuery GET or POST methods. Ultimately the code uses the image path to replace the existing displaying image with a new one.
